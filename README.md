## Introduction
This simple utility library enables you to retrieve specific details about the connection agent, allowing you to enhance the user experience based on connection data. For example, if you detect a mobile connection, you can prompt the user to download the mobile app if your system has one. Additionally, you can provide a more tailored experience for Android users or differentiate options, menus, and other elements for desktop or mobile users.

In essence, you have a world of possibilities at your fingertips.

## Available Methods

| ------ | ----------- |
| `Agent::get()` | Returns the current connection agent detected by the server. |
| `Agent::detect()->isMobile()` | Checks if the agent comes from a mobile device. |
| `Agent::detect()->isDesktop()` | Returns `true` if the user is accessing from a desktop device. |
| `Agent::detect()->isIPhone()` | Returns `true` if the user's agent corresponds to an iPhone. |
| `Agent::detect()->isMacintosh()` | Returns `true` if the user's agent corresponds to a Macintosh operating system. |
